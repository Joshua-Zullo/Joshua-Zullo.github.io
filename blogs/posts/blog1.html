                <p>
                 I started making my website and realized it was a lot of repetition. There are a lot of repeated tasks. 
                 I must learn to use the tools pros do if I wanted to be efficient.
                </p>
                 <p>
                 For example, every single page needed a nav bar. But copying code perhaps 40 times for 40 files is not efficient.
                 I would have to do it another way. Then there was CSS. CSS makes a website look pretty, it adds colors and proportions
                 versus having bare ugly text. Yet, raw CSS seems cumbersome and I don't remember it. I would have to find some add-on, 
                 some library to use.
                 </p>
                <p>
                These issues are not unique to myself. By searching online, and consulting others who have more skill and experience than me,
                    I should be able to find the expertise I need to build my website at a reasonable pace. Time will tell how this progresses 
                    and whether it will be worth anything.
                </p>
